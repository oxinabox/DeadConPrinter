Japan’s once-thriving animation industry is undergoing an unprecedented decline. Studios are closing, the number of anime films in cinemas is falling, audiences in general are moving onto other things, and reliable stalwarts of the medium such as Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata have announced their retirement. What does the future hold for anime? Who are the new directors worth watching? What are the current trends in genre and visual aesthetics? What will anime – and anime fandom – look like in five years’ time? Is it possible that we are seeing the end, for all intents and purposes, of Japanese animation?

Food has been used in books such as the Kushiels’ Dart series, A Song of Fire and Ice, and the Legend of the Seeker. How did the authors use food in their books?\\\\Soylent green is people.

It has been impossible not to notice the enormous commercial and critical success of young adult fiction over the past decade, as science fiction and fantasy books ostensibly aimed at teenage readers leap into the bestsellers charts and are regularly picked up by Hollywood to create the latest big-budget Summer blockbusters. What happened for YA fiction to become such a popular type of literature? What, if anything, does it offer that adult fiction does not? How useful is it as a form for creating speculative fiction, and what are its limitations? Most importantly of all: where does YA go from here?

All things considered, Batman is probably the most popular superhero of all time. He recently celebrated his 75th birthday, he stars in numerous comic books each month, and for decades he’s been adapted for animation, television, videogames and film. The problem is: should we like him at all? He’s presented as a masked crime fighter saving the lives of countless Gothamites, but when you think about it he’s also a mentally unhinged billionaire who dresses in fetish outfits every night and assaults the mentally unwell. Come take a look at Batman and his fictional universe from a fresher perspective: you may not like what you see.

Horror films produced around the world are regularly picked up and re-made in Hollywood as glossy English-language duplicates, to be re-sold and distributed back around the world. Whether it’s The Ring, Let Me In, The Grudge or countless others, it seems there’s no good idea that the USA’s film studios won’t latch onto and adapt for American audiences. How to these adaptations change to appeal to new audiences? What is lost in the process and what, if anything, can be gained? What does a big-budget American film mean for the original production?

In the world of professional publishing, who ultimately decides which novels get published, and which do not? What are the factors at play in determining what kinds of books come out, when they come out, how long or short they are, and what formats they are published in? Why your favourite author’s novel has come out late, early, or in A-format paperback, or why it hasn’t come out at all? Why do good books slip through the cracks? Why do bad books turn up on every bookstore shelf? We present an insight into the publishing industry, with all of the answers you wanted to know – and a few about which you would probably rather remain ignorant.

There’s a strand of SF that likes to consider our ultimate demise. In the middle of the last century that was likely to be through nuclear conflagration. Nowadays it’s climate change disaster. But portraying the antagonist as an elemental force rather than a ‘bunch of nuke-crazy Reds’ brings its own challenges from a writing perspective. How have writers tackled these very real fears over the past decade or so, and is there still room for a happy ending?

Even with his best friend Valnor by his side, King Hadrian is on edge and feels helpless to protect the land of Padallia. High above the city of Dunarran, Queen Ardea maintains a worried vigil over the dark stain of the Wood from her tower window and watches for her husband's return. Wylden, a Fae Ranger, is also caught in the storm as he searches for the answers that his Elders are unwilling to give him.\\\\The storm breaks with an unparalleled ferocity, and rages through the night. No one escapes unscathed, and Padallia will be changed forever.

Dr Andrew Williams, Curtin University\\\\The Square Kilometre Array will be the biggest telescope ever built, tens or hundreds of times more sensitive than any other radio telescope. It's going to be built on two sites, one in South Africa and the other here in WA. The only problem was that the original design was costed at three times as much money as was available to build it...\\\\The complex 're-baselining' negotiations have just finished, and the SKA office have released the new SKA layout and adjusted timeline. I'll talk about what that will mean to the project as a whole as well as us here in WA. I'll also talk about the telescope I work on, the Murchison Widefield Array, a direct precursor to the low-frequency part of the SKA.

as seen in 2014\\\\Ugg-Tect Royale: The Second Clubbing.\\ Ugg-Tect Royal will be showing at Swancon 40. This modification of the hilarious Ugg-Tect party game pits 4 highly skilled (mystified looks a specialty) along with their long suffering Ugg-Tects against each other in a race to complete megalithic monuments. While the audience and the Ugg-Tects know what the structure is meant to look like, the builders have no idea, and instructions are in strict caveman talk and gesture.\\Leece \& Rob are for looking for up to 16 participants with good communications skills and the ability to work in a small, tightly integrated team. They must be willing to provide endless looks of confusion, bafflement and frustration.

By 1994 Walt Disney Animation Studios had broken box office records around the world with The Lion King and was coasting high on the success of a string of massive hits. Just 10 years later and the studio was all but closed, with traditional animation falling in the path of CGI and Disney’s once-firmed monopoly shattered by a range of competitors. This presentation tracks the development of Walt Disney animation over that decade and explores how studio interference, accelerated production schedules and some of the strangest creative choices ever made brought a once-great studio to its knees.

Despite a growing range of titles being released across a variety of genres, American comic books remain dominated by superhero adventures. What is it about this definitively American genre that makes it so popular? What are its core conventions – the elements without which the genre simply stops working? How far can you stretch the superhero narrative before it breaks? Perhaps more importantly: what would it take for the USA to break its addiction to superheroes once and for all?

It has been more than 45 years since Ursula Le Guin’s novel The Left Hand of Darkness stunned readers with its thoughtful and ground-breaking portrayal of shifting gender and sexuality. Almost five decades later, it remains one of the commonly cited examples of science fiction that pushes the boundary of gender identity and sexuality. How far have we come since then? How are contemporary writers exploring these concepts and ideas, and to what extent – if any – has the real world followed or even overtaken them? What responsibility do authors have to reflect or provoke gender issues in their fiction?

The island seemed so peaceful but you and your tribe soon realise it's getting smaller. That can't be good. As lowland areas succumb to the waves you heave sighs of relief as you all head for the boats pointed at the mainland. But it looks like everyone else has the same idea, and there aren't enough boats. Oh well, you can swim. Try to avoid the sharks but perhaps the dolphins will help. And you're sure that the rumours of Giant Octopus and Sea Serpents are completely unfounded. Anyone still in the water or on on Atlantis when the volcano erupts isn't going to be contributing genes to the mainland settlements.

"Based in Perth, Western Australia, the LCBC sponsored by Comiczone is a monthly meet-up exclusively for women focusing on a selected comic text to discuss in a book club format. The club caters to both to comic novices and experienced readers. The LCBC is all about creating a physical space free of judgement for women who are often targeted for being interested in a traditionally ‘male oriented’ activity. There is a risk that creating an exclusively female event would perpetuate the sort of negative, sex- and gender-based negativity we see manifest in things such as “Gamergate”. However, this event and its purposes do not have any root in strengthening the split between fans based on sex/gender. The events advocate a love of comics, not anything else. Although the LCBC is undeniably exclusive, it’s not anti-male. It is better described as pro-female."

Humanity’s ultimate merging with the machine is a dream – or nightmare – depending on which Hollywood trope you subscribe to, but what would it really be like and how would it happen? Would a transhuman feel less human or more, and would they be the best judge of the change? Could they still love, hope, create if their conscious thoughts were reduced to a stream of ones and zeroes? Would they still feel tethered in the real world or lost in the infinite possibilities of virtual reality? Our panellists consider the many and varied ways that true transhumanism will change us forever.

How Well Do You Know People? Will your friend get that esoteric reference you were talking about just the other day? There will be a Dixit Tournament of an elimination round for up to 36 players followed by a final round for the winning six.\\\\Dixit is a beautiful game with surreal, dreamlike cards. During the game the player selects a card, and indicates something about it or what it inspires to the other players without showing it to them. The other players choose cards from their hands that they think might also evoke this thing. The selected cards are all shuffled and laid out face up for players to vote on – which was the original card? Subtle, beautiful and described both as a party game for gamers and a gamer's game for party gamers Dixit is a game everyone should try at least once. Preferably with a whole bunch of strangers and one person you know very well.

When using science, what are the good parts and the bad parts? How can we be better at it without memorizing physics books?

New science fiction novels are published every year. With a constantly growing pool of works from which to choose, how should successive generations of SF readers approach the classic novels of the 21st century? As time passes, more and more writers run the risk of becoming overlooked, relegated to memory, or even abandoned altogether. Who are the authors whose works continue to stand up today? Who are the forgotten authors whose works require rediscovery? Who – if any – remain popular today, but whose writing is probably best put aside for good?

Science fiction regularly deals with the ‘big dumb object’, the strange alien monolith that is discovered on a distant planet, or which floats ominously into our solar system. What is the appeal of the giant alien object, and why does it inspire so many science fiction stories and novels? Is it a trope that has been over-used and worn out, or are new directions possible for this very specific sub-genre of science fiction?

The island seemed so peaceful but you and your tribe soon realise it's getting smaller. That can't be good. As lowland areas succumb to the waves you heave sighs of relief as you all head for the boats pointed at the mainland. But it looks like everyone else has the same idea, and there aren't enough boats. Oh well, you can swim. Try to avoid the sharks but perhaps the dolphins will help. And you're sure that the rumours of Giant Octopus and Sea Serpents are completely unfounded. Anyone still in the water or on on Atlantis when the volcano erupts isn't going to be contributing genes to the mainland settlements.

This card game will have you narrowly surveying your cards for the one that fits best. Fast, fun and sometimes frustrating, try to ensure that your opponents get to take cards, while you avoid taking cards yourself. If you're forced to, try to set up others to take a fall.

So Google Glass seems to be somewhat of a failure, yet at the same time Microsoft are launching their own AR games platform. Smart watches seem to be in every catalog, but a watch you need to charge every 3 hours seems less than practical. What is coming down the pipe. What is next? What do you do when your implanted tech gets obsoleted?
