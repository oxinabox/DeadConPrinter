But what happens when speaking in opposition to the government or to associating with individuals who hold a different political view is defined as a crime? This presentation explores three early Twentieth Century dystopian novels in which a central authoritarian government rules its population with an iron fist and crushes any opposition within its own population. Part of the narrative of each of these novels is the use of the principles of CPTED as a way of preventing and detecting political dissent (state-lead political violence). The presenters propose that this evil twin of CPTED could be called Political Control Through Environmental Design (PCTEP)."
