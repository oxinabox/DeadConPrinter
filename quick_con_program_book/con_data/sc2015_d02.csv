The LCBC is all about creating a physical space free of judgement for women who are often targeted for being interested in a traditionally ‘male oriented’ activity. There is a risk that creating an exclusively female event would perpetuate the sort of negative, sex- and gender-based negativity we see manifest in things such as “Gamergate”. However, this event and its purposes do not have any root in strengthening the split between fans based on sex/gender. The events advocate a love of comics, not anything else. Although the LCBC is undeniably exclusive, it’s not anti-male. It is better described as pro-female."""

This presentation will examine how film pioneers contructed versions of possible futures through costume. It will examine some of the political, social and cultural ramifications of these constructions. It will explore how film costume converses with current fashion trends  and will also look briefly at the relationship between film costume and contemporary SF illustration. This is a preliminary survey of what I hope will become a longer work. The main films explored will include:  Le voyage dans la Lune (1902),  Aelita (1924), Metropolis (1927), Just imagine (1930) and Things to Come (1936)."
