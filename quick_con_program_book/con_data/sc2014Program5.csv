What are the factors at play in determining what kinds of books come out, when they come out, how long or short they are, and what formats they are published in? Why your favourite author’s novel has come out late, early, or in A-format paperback, or why it hasn’t come out at all? Why do good books slip through the cracks?

Even with his best friend Valnor by his side, King Hadrian is on edge and feels helpless to protect the land of Padallia.

The Licktoad goblins of Brinestump Marsh have stumbled upon a great treasure—fireworks! Yet unfortunately for them, the tribe member responsible for the discovery has already been exiled for the abhorrent crime of writing (which every goblin knows steals words from your head). To remedy this situation, the Licktoads’ leader, His Mighty Girthness Chief Rendwattle Gutwad, has declared that the greatest heroes of the tribe must venture forth to retrieve the rest of the fireworks from a derelict ship stranded in the marsh. In order to prove themselves as the Licktoads’ bravest goblins, the PCs must complete a series of dangerous dares, from swallowing bull slugs and braving the dreaded Earbiter to dancing with Squealy Nord himself. Yet even once they’ve proven their mettle, the adventure is just beginning. For the ship in question is far from uninhabited, and Vorka the cannibal goblin would like nothing better than a few tasty visitors...."

The club caters to both to comic novices and experienced readers. The LCBC is all about creating a physical space free of judgement for women who are often targeted for being interested in a traditionally ‘male oriented’ activity. There is a risk that creating an exclusively female event would perpetuate the sort of negative, sex- and gender-based negativity we see manifest in things such as “Gamergate”. However, this event and its purposes do not have any root in strengthening the split between fans based on sex/gender. The events advocate a love of comics, not anything else. Although the LCBC is undeniably exclusive, it’s not anti-male. It is better described as pro-female."""

Humanity’s ultimate merging with the machine is a dream – or nightmare – depending on which Hollywood trope you subscribe to, but what would it really be like and how would it happen? With more and more smart wearables, where does transhumanism begin and end? Would a transhuman feel less human or more, and would they be the best judge of the change? Could they still love, hope, create if their conscious thoughts were reduced to a stream of ones and zeroes? Would they still feel tethered in the real world or lost in the infinite possibilities of virtual reality?

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
 
It is a time of misguided opposition against the Glorious Empire. The galaxy is being torn apart by a war resulting from the ever increasing ambition of the so called Rebel Alliance. In a recent daring strike, the Rebels have slipped through the Imperial Security Forces and commandeered an Imperial Intelligence Corvette, Stalker. Their plan, steal the names of every imperial agent operating throughout the sector. During their rushed escape, Rebel General Lucian and his band of misfits, miscalculated the vessel’s hyperspace jump, sending the damaged corvette into an asteroid field. The Imperial Cruiser, Relentless, has been dispatched from a nearby system to recover the Stalker. Currently enroute, The Relentless and her loyal crew prepare for the upcoming operation... The PCs (stormtroopers/imperial officers/special agents) must board the corvette, fight their way through legions of misguided Rebel soldiers and their support droids and take control of the damaged vessel."
