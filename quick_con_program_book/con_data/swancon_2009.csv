Abstract: Neil Gaiman is the multi-award winning and best-selling author
of some of the most critically acclaimed fantasy fiction published
during the past 20 years. What I will seek to do in this paper is to
conduct a brief survey of the existing scholarly critical literature on
Gaimanâ€™s work. Whist I am not trying to be exhaustive, I will engage
with as much of the literature as space allows. I also aim to identify
the trends and common foci of this critical literature, as well as
suggesting areas, works and themes that may be particularly deserving of
future scholarly interest."

Science fiction and fantasy books feature prominently in the pantheon of banned books.

Classics of the genre including Slaughterhouse Five and Brave New World still raise frequent objections. What is it about these books and the genres of fantasy and science fiction in general that raise the ire of those who would control what we

Modern boardgames (also called Euro- , Designer- or German-games) share a number of characteristics which distinguish them from better known games (the Risk and Monopoly of our youth perhaps). They tend to be playable in a relatively short period of time (usually 60-90 minutes),  have relatively simple rules, be well balanced (it is rare for a player to be out of contention halfway through a game) and generally avoid direct conflict between players. High production values are common â€“ these games often look beautiful.

Sessions will run from 11am to 6pm on Friday and Sunday, at scheduled times, starting with a brief discussion of modern games and their mechanics. Knowledgeable and enthusiastic game guides will teach groups how to play a variety of games. Each different game you play during the day will give you an entry in the draw for a daily boardgame prize.

A wide selection of games will be available, and players will be able to 'book in' to play a game at a particular time."

Modern boardgames (also called Euro- , Designer- or German-games) share a number of characteristics which distinguish them from better known games (the Risk and Monopoly of our youth perhaps). They tend to be playable in a relatively short period of time (usually 60-90 minutes),  have relatively simple rules, be well balanced (it is rare for a player to be out of contention halfway through a game) and generally avoid direct conflict between players. High production values are common â€“ these games often look beautiful.

Sessions will run from 11am to 6pm on Friday and Sunday, at scheduled times, starting with a brief discussion of modern games and their mechanics. Knowledgeable and enthusiastic game guides will teach groups how to play a variety of games. Each different game you play during the day will give you an entry in the draw for a daily boardgame prize.

A wide selection of games will be available, and players will be able to 'book in' to play a game at a particular time."

The sublime is a historical idea that emerged as people began discovering the universe and the world around them in Europe. Thus, it is as Kant called it, the mathematical pleasures of this sublime that are one such pleasure. Another, also proposed by Kant, is the dynamically sublime, which encounters the unknowable. I also propose two more: one, the digital sublime, that has appeared in an age of reproduction and relates to the spectacle of late modernity; and finally, the oceanic sublime, that emerged in Ancient Greece as people looked beyond their city-states and into the world of international trade. I will look quickly at four books that illustrate these different sublimes."

The sheer volume of this material makes such an exhaustive reading impossible.  But I've now been reading for two years, and have mastered most of the many hundreds of substantial studies of Tolkien and his realm.  My presentation surveys this literature, and comments on both its rich variety and its critical weaknesses.  The argument will conclude with an indictment of critics' inability or unwillingness to address Tolkien's ideological dimension in its complex historical origins and ambiguous contemporary resonances."

""A more honest one, where sex isn't shameful or degrading. I wish this was the kind of world where say, 'Wow, I'd like to touch your breasts,' and people would understand that it's not a way of reducing you to a set of nipples and ignoring the rest of you, but rather a way of saying that I may not yet know your mind, but your body is beautiful.""*
 
*We were standing in the hallway of ConFusion, about nine of us, and we all nodded. Then another friend spoke up.*
 
*""You can touch my boobs,"" she said to all of us in the hallway. ""It's no big deal.""*

In 2008, at Penguicon, an annual SF and software convention in Michigan USA, a group of friends carried out an â€˜experimentâ€™ they later labelled The Open Source Boob Project (OSBP). Women attending the convention were invited to wear little coloured badgesâ€”green representing â€˜yes you may ask to touch my breastsâ€™ and red to signify a preference to opt out of the boob touching festivities. After the con one of the projects participants, who uses the Internet pseudonym The Ferret, blogged his experience of the project on his live journal and enthusiastically described the event as â€œa raging successâ€.
 
The most interesting part about the OSBP is not so much that a bunch of fans got together and thought â€˜hey, wouldnâ€™t it be great if we could all touch womenâ€™s boobs freely without being made to feel like pervertsâ€ but rather the way that, through the relatively new medium of web 2.0, the event gained international attention and further OSBP experiments were ceased due to by widespread feminist outrage.
 
In this paper I will discuss the Ferretâ€™s original post, the reaction it provoked, and look at some of the outcomes generated by the blogosphere. In particular I will discuss the artworks I created as commentary on the OSBP as part of my PhD work into cyberfeminism and web 2.0."
