In a fit of homicidal rage, you attempt to kill your grandfather before he conceived your mother. Suppose you succeed, and your grandfather dies at your hand. Then you will never be born and you will never travel back in time to kill your grandfather. So your grandfather both lives and dies. Paradox! Suppose, instead you fail. Why do you fail? What is it that stops you from taking your grandfatherâ??s life? If one is unable to kill oneâ??s grandfather, do the paradoxes of time travel therefore threaten oneâ??s free will? Can the paradoxes be avoided by introducing higher temporal dimensions in which grandfathers can be freely killed without consequence? And are we forced to posit a mysterious â??logical guardianâ??, hell bent on ironing out paradoxes wherever they arise? This talk will take you on a multi-dimensional tour of philosophy and time.

The first documented use of entomology (the study of insects) in a forensic setting was in China in the 13th century, when farmers were instructed to lay down their scythes, revealing a murderer by the attraction of flies to their bloodied blade. In the last few decades forensic entomology has developed into an important tool in crime scene analysis.  Applications range from the determination of the time since death to detecting the movement of the body, to an analysis of chemicals in a body.  Forensic entomology is also applied in cases of food contamination, and in animal or human abuse or neglect situations.  Our pesky fellow Aussies can be more helpful than hindrance.
