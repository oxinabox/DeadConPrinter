Conputing and telecommunications are a ubiquitous part of our lives that impact our social networks, financial systems, critical infrastructure such as power, water, social networks, financial systems and telecommunications. Technology has improved to the extent that we have small wireless computers, commercially available neural interfaces (Project Epoc Headsets from Emotive Systems) and Motion Control (wii) devices. Moreover, private enterprise (e.g. Commonwealth Bank) is seeking to reduce it's total cost of ownership for its computing and telecommunications by buying it as a service via cloud computing (e.g. Google, Microsoft). The UK Government is setting up its own internal cloud computing service for government agencies with an anticipated saving of Â£3.2 billion annually. There are those that will seek to take advantage of the ubiquity and concentration of technology to carry out their criminal, political and economic agendas. We have seen large scale cyber attacks to governments in Georgia and Estonia via botnets, floods etc. and government have seen that there are credible threats to cyberspace and their national security and have set up internal groups in their military to carry out and defend against cyberattacks, funded cross boundary exercises (Cyberstorm I, II and III), established national fora (IMPACT) to address these threats.
