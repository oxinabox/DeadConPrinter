However, when fans speak back about problems with the text, such as racism, sexism, or deliberately including queer subtext with no intent to ever have queer representation on the show, showrunners often react poorly, saying fans are over-reacting or worse. 

Do showrunners have a responsibility to listen to fans respectfully once they’ve broken the fourth wall? Do shows have a responsibility to address problems fans raise, and increase respectful queer representation if they harness slash fans to increase buzz? Join us for a discussion in which we consider the ethics and responsibilities on both sides, in a post-fourth-wall world.

Because these are the three subjects that are most likely to offend someone. Perhaps ""sex"" has become a less taboo subject, but in many cases, discussing deviation in ""Sexuality"" has not.
 
So, why is it that these subjects have become inextricably linked? Is the “culture war” between science and religion a new or old conflict? Is the separation of church and state narrowing? Why are attempts to legalise gay marriage meeting with such strong resistance?
 
So come on down for a healthy and deep discussion of the Holy (or Unholy) Trinity of small-talk’s greatest enemies.
